 Selenium WebDriver Architecture: The best way to explain (Deep dive into Selenium BackEnd):

**Learn How Selenium WebDriver works internally:

When the automation script is executed, the following steps happen:

+for each Selenium command, a HTTP request is created and sent to the browser driver
+the browser driver uses a HTTP server for getting the HTTP requests
the HTTP server determines the steps needed for implementing the Selenium command
+the implementation steps are executed on the browser
+the execution status is sent back to the HTTP server
+the HTTP server sends the status back to the automation script
